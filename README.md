If you want to see how the project progressed, you can do so by looking at the code across the different branches. Here's the progression:

  - **start** - the skeleton
  - **Step1-AddFetch** - add in call to the API
  - **Step2-EvnTsConfig** - put config into the `environment.ts` file
  - **Step3-JsonConfig** - change config to use `aurelia-configuration` plugin
  - **master** - modify Karma tests to run headless and produce coverage reports
